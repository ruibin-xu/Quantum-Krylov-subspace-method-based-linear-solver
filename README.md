# **Quantum Krylov-subsapce method based linear solver**
### This is the numerical simulation code for [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06359v1)
## Structure

Our main code consists of three main parts:

1,The [`QKSL.ipynb`](QKSL.ipynb) file is to show the QKSL under ideally condition;

2,The [`Fourier_Approach.ipynb`](Childs.ipynb) file is to show the Fourier approach under ideally condition.

3,The [`The_novel_Hadamard_test.ipynb`](variant_Hadamard_test.ipynb) file is to show the novel approach(i.e. the novel Hadamard-Test).

4,The [`Data.md`](Data.md) file contains all the parameters of the Hamiltonian used in this paper.
